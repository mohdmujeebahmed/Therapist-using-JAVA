🤖 Java Therapist GUI 💆‍♂️💻
Welcome to the Java Therapist GUI – your personal digital therapist that doesn't judge and only gives you the best advice! 💬🎉

🔥 What is this?
This is a Java desktop application where YOU are the star. ✨ Answer a set of questions, and BAM 💥, you get a score on your stress levels along with some advice that might just save your day (or at least make you smile). 😎 Plus, there’s music! Not just any music, but stress-busting tunes that’ll make you feel like you’re at a spa 🧖‍♀️.

🎤 Features that’ll make you go “Wow, I need this in my life!”
Personalized Fun 🎉: Enter your name and age (you’re a rockstar).

Stress-O-Meter 📊: Answer some super simple questions and find out just how zen (or not) you are.

Background Music 🎶: Feel the stress melt away with some chill beats (yes, your very own personal DJ).

Real Talk 💬: Based on your score, we give you the best stress-busting advice. Want to do some yoga or maybe just “breathe in and breathe out”? 🤔

🧠 How does it work?
Start with a name (Yes, we want to know who you are, but only because we care about you 😘).

Answer questions using a cool slider. Don’t worry, it’s not a math test. 📚

Get your score at the end and receive advice that might include exercising, chilling, or eating some chocolate 🍫.

Relax with some calming background music 🎶 (and maybe play it on repeat until the stress is gone?).

🎶 Can I listen to music while I play?
HECK YEAH! We’ve got the tunes 🎧. Two songs to vibe to:

Sad Song – For when your score is really stressing you out. 😔

Climax Song – When your score is high, we celebrate with an epic jam! 🥳



🏋️‍♂️ What will you get out of this?
A better understanding of your stress levels: Are you cool as a cucumber 🥒 or on the edge? Find out.

Suggestions to improve mental health: Some exercises, deep breathing, or maybe just the right playlist. 💪

A reason to laugh: This project is all about having fun while figuring out what’s going on in your mind! 😂
